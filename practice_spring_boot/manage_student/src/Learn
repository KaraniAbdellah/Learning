// Spring Data
/*
    - So Spring is big project and we have spring boot
        --> We Have Also Spring Data (JPA & Hibernate)
    - Before If We Want To Connect To Database we have "JDBC"
        --> we use native query like (select * from ...)
    - Know we have Spring Data:
        --> we have built in function
    - ORM(Object Relational Mapping): We Represent Table as java class and can insert, delete in java class
--------------------------------------
    - Spring Data (Entity):
        is we convert all table to ORM
    - Spring Boot (Repository):
        the direct interaction with database (insert, delete, ...) happen in this place
    - Spring Boot (DTO):
        is simple java class used to transfer the data between Controller and Client
