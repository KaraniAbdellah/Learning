# How react native works:
##
    Idea Behind React Native if to combine(Java/Kotlin for android and Objective-C/Swift for IOS)
    and make them work together, but Js need Engine to be run.

    IOS have JavaScriptCore Engine for run/execute code, Android No but
         will be brought along with the React Native framework.

    Java/Obj-C deffrent Programming Language the can not spear directly
        --> we should be use JSON, this set of communication use programms called Bridge.

    During BuildTime native code will be compile into Java/Obj-C, and Js code
        will be bundled using Metro Bundler (js Library that it regroupe all js/css/html filies
        in one js/css/html file).

    Questions
        is that code generate two times ?
        - No, we have two code base
        --> React native run directly in device
        --> Js code (generate by bundle) --> Metro

        Why we generate two code ?
        - Becuase Android/IOS can not understand js code, that why we
            Need Engine to run js and Excecute it (Hermes/JavaScriptCore)

        NOTE ?
        - Native code → Java/Kotlin (Android) or Objective-C/Swift (iOS) → runs directly on the device.
        - JavaScript code → your React Native components → runs inside the JavaScript engine
            that is included in the app.
    
    React Native Thread:
        When app runs, the device create three threads
        - Main Thread: this where app runing reponsable of rendering UI in Screen.
        - JavaScript Thread: this where business logic executed
        - Shadow Thread: responsable for compute the positions of the views.

    React native Bridge:
        Bridge Allow change data between Js code and Native code Via Json.
        "Same Logic in FrontEnd/Backend" But Front/Backend Does not need to know each other.
        - User touch event
        - Serialized message send via Bridge with all necessary data (JSON)
        - Js recieve message, and deserializes message and decide what to do (change icon)
        - Js send message to Native code
        - The native side receives the message, deserializes it and updates the view.

    Problem with Bridge:
        Bridge Work asynchronous (send all in same time)
        --> that JSI — JavaScript Interface Come

# What is Expo:
##
    My Code: Writtin in Js
    Expo: translate code in native code (Java/Objective-C)
    Phone: phone run result in real app

    Example: Camera.takePicture() --> Expo translate js code for phone can understand
##


# What is Expo Go:
##
    React Native has two parts:
    - JavaScript part – your app logic (no rebuild needed)
    - Native part – Java/Swift code (needs rebuild)
        If you change anything in the Native part, you must rebuild the
        entire app using Android Studio or Xcode --> run it again
##


# Reset React Native App
##
    npm run reset-app --> for delete all components, .. that come in installations
##


# React Router
##
    For navigation in RN we have two options --> [react navigation, expo router]
##


## React Native Structure

    NOTE: Setup RN app with Expo not like just RN Basic SetUp in Structure
    WITH EXPO:
        --> app: Just UI (features with entry files to this feature --> MAKE IT IN modules)
        --> modules: define features (components, utlis, hooks, services, ...)
        --> components: Global Reusable components
        --> hooks: global hooks (useTheme, ...)
        --> env: folder
        --> utlis: like (formatData.ts, validateEmail.ts)
        --> services: Global Api services
