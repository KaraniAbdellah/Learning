// What is Ts:
/*
    is super set for js
    at end ts will be transpiler to js
    we need ts for runtime errors --> we can detect errors at compile time
        compile time or static type checking [detect errors before run the code]
    Every Js file is valid in ts file

*/

// Compiler vs Trandpiler
/*
    Compiler: from high level code to low level code
    Transpiler: from high level code to high level code
*/


// Run Ts code
/*
    we run js code with node js ---> ts code can not run it with node
        because node js understand just js code
    
    RUN: tsc index.ts
        index.js will be create auto
