// Constrcator Part 2
/*
    - Copy Constructor
        constructor that create an object
        using another object

    - Call to default constructor
        if we do not write construtor

    - Finalizers vs Destructor
        used when end to use the object, 
        we remove space in memory(heap)
        +Destructor
            Java does not have destructors like C++
            Java has garbage collection, which automatically cleans up memory.
        +Finalizers || finalize method
            were used for cleanup but are not recommended.
