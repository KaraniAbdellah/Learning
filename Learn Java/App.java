/*
    Abstraction: hiding the internal implementation(method,feature)
        and only showing the functionality to the users.
    
    We achieve Abstraction By:
        Abstract Class
        Interface
    
    Abstract Class:
        - non-access modifiers
        - Class declared with abstract keyword is known as an abstract
            class in java. (can have abstrcat || no abstrcat method)
        - Allow you to create blueprints for concrete classes
        - Concrete class: is a class that has an implmentation
            for all methods (that are abstracted)
        - NOTE: we define just the prototype, the Method
            will be implmented in Classes.
        - cannot be instantiated
        - can we have constrcator & static & final (Methods)
