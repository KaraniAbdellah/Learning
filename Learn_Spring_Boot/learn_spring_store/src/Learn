// What I Will Learn
/*
    - Getting Started with Spring Boot
    - Dependency Injection (DI)
    - Database Integration With Spring Boot (JPA)
    - Understand The Project Structure
    - Build and run first application
    -----------
    - Using Spring Boot DevTools
    - Configuring your application
    - Debugging your application
*/



// Intro Spring vs Spring Boot
/*
    - Both of them is Framework
    - The Problem with Problem is slowly in production (some tasks manually)
    - Spring Boot fix that (ready to use feature) --> Save Time
*/



// Project Structure
/*
    pom.xml --> Project Object Model is file that
        maven define configuration, dependencies.
        Like package.json
    main --> folder we write application
        java --> write java code
            SpringBootDabastockApplication: Entries Point
        resources --> no java file [config like PORT, URLDB]
*/



// Dependencies Management
/*
    for building web app we need:
        tomcat, web libs, webmvc(building APIS)

    instead of use all that we can use "Starter Dependency"
        --> use Maven Control --> like npm, ...

    the best practice if to remove version from dependencies --> it inherit version
*/



// Building First Controllers
/*
    Spring MVC (mode, vue, controller):
        mode = data + logic (connect to db)
        view = what the users sees
        controller = Mediator
*/



// Running Spring Boot Application && Debugging
/*
    Running:
        - ./mvnw spring-boot:run --> run it in terminal
        - click to run button
    Debugging:
        Using Terminal
        Using IntelliJ Debugger --> I Do not Understand this lesson know "may be letter"
*/



// Auto Restart
/*
    install spring-boot-devtools:
        add tags <optional>true</optional>
            --> means this pack used just in development not in production
*/



// Configuration Application Properties
/*
    Any Every Application We Need to configure a different setting:
