// How the HTML Work
/*
    To understand how html work we should be understand this
        principle that help to show the web page in browser:

    - HTML (Parsing)
        When you type a website address (URL) in your browser,
        the first thing the browser does is request the HTML file
        from the server where the website is stored. After that,
        the browser starts reading the file line by line and analyzes
        and interprets the "tags" (like <p> for paragraphs and <h1>
        for main headings) and the content inside them. The tags give
        structure to the page.

    - DOM Tree
        After Browser read the html file. briwser start making DOM tree 
        each node of tree has a tag element.
        this tree very important because he try to understand the architect 
        of the your html file
    
    - CSSOM
        always HTML file has links like: (<link>, <script>, ...)
        browser read this filies for make a CSSOM(CSS Object Model)
        and this object decide how ele should be in wee page inside of (colors, position, ...)

        # after that browser take DOM & CSSOM to make Render Tree.
        # Rendre Tree used by brower to show you the website

    - JavaScript Filies
        Browser start processing the Js Filies and this processing can affect to Render Tree

    - Rendering
        after Render Tree ready, the browser start display the websites
    
    - Deep Linking
        Browser start link the page by address like:
            https://example.com with this https://example.com/path/page

    the browser creates three trees: DOM, CSSOM, and Render Tree to build the webpage.
