// How the HTML Work
/*
    To understand how html work we should be understand this
        principle that help to show the web page in browser:

    - HTML (Parsing)
        When you type a website address (URL) in your browser,
        the first thing the browser does is request the HTML file
        from the server where the website is stored. After that,
        the browser starts reading the file line by line and analyzes
        and interprets the "tags" (like <p> for paragraphs and <h1>
        for main headings) and the content inside them. The tags give
        structure to the page.
