// What is Angular
/*
    Framework for SPA
    built by Google
    has huge community
*/


// Benefits
/*
    Faster Code Generation with (CLI)
    Unit-tests ready
*/


// Get Started
/* 
    sudo npm install -g @angular/cli --> Angular CLI
    ng new <project-name> 
    --> this folder was not actually created in disk --> use an option
*/


// What are Angular Comonenets
/*
    @Component: Decorator
    Each Componenets Has An Attribute, so in css you can find:
        h1[_ngcontent-ng-c2283532919] {color: red;}
*/
@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    imports: [RouterOutlet],
    // templateUrl: './home.html',
    // template: './home.html',
    // styleUrl: "./css/style.css",
    template: '<h1>Hello World</h1>',
    styles: [`
      h1 {
        color: red;
      }
      `]
})


// Creating Components
/*
    We Can Create Just by just By CLI:
        nh generate component header || ng g c header
        ng g c component/header
        ng g c component/header --dry-run --> header does not create in my project
        
        NOTE: The "dryRun" flag means no changes were made.
