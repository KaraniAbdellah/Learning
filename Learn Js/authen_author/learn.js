    JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for handling authentication (storing tokens for user sessions).
    bcrypt.js for hashing passwords before storing them in the database.
    Passport.js (optional) for simplifying authentication strategies.

    Start with bcrypt.js for password hashing, 
    then use JWT for authentication, and optionally 
    add Passport.js for simplifying strategies.
