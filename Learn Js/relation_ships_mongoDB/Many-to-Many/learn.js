// Many-to-Many Relationship
/* 
    A many-to-many relationship in MongoDB using Mongoose is implemented with an array of references. 
    Example: Students and Courses, where:
    --> A student can enroll in multiple courses.
    --> A course can have multiple students.

    Initially, the first student and course have no link between them.  
    We must link them using the /enroll route.
